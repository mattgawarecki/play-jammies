{Name}
===========

#### A JSON API-compatible HTTP error handler for Play! 2.4.x

**{Name}** is an implementation of the Play Framework's ```HttpErrorHandler``` interface that handles errors by sending JSON responses. It's a small project, but it has a lot going for it:

* {Name} is **easy to use!** ([see below](#Usage))
* {Name} is backed by a **large unit test suite**.
* {Name}'s permissive **MIT license** allows it to be used almost anywhere.
* {Name} aims to be **fully compliant with the JSON API standard** (http://jsonapi.org), insofar as errors go.

### Installation
{Name} is supported on the Play Framework version 2.4.x and above. To start using it, you'll simply need to add two configuration entries to your project.

The first entry goes in your project's ```build.sbt``` file, inside the ```libraryDependencies``` section. This tells Play! to download {Name} and make it available for use in your application. Add it like so:

    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
        // (... some other dependencies, maybe ...)
        "com.mattgawarecki.play" % "{Name}" % "latest.stable"
        // (... some more dependencies, maybe ...)
    )

**NOTE:** ```latest.stable``` in the example above indicates that the latest stable version of {Name} should be downloaded. If you want to use a different version, please feel free to change this value. For a list of all versions, visit [{Name} at the Central Maven Repository]().

The second entry should be added to your application's ```conf/application.conf``` file. This entry tells Play! to use {Name} whenever an error occurs:

    play.http.errorHandler = "com.mattgawarecki.play.http.handlers.JsonApiHttpErrorHandler"

### Configuration
By default, {Name} tries to expose the details of any error it handles in the ```detail``` field of the response it generates. You can configure this setting manually by adding the following entry to your project's ```conf/application.conf``` file:

    errors.showDetail=true

**NOTE:** To protect potentially-sensitive information about internal application behavior and/or architecture, error details will not be shown by default if the application is running in "production" mode (e.g., running from a deployed binary generated by ```activator dist```). The above configuration entry overrides this behavior, however.

### Creating your own responses
You can also use {Name} to create error responses manually in your application's code. This is great for situations in which Play! has accepted the incoming request on a low level, but you detect an error condition on your own.

There are basically three ways to create an error response:
* Call any one of the following "convenient" pre-defined response methods from the ```JsonApiErrorResponse``` class:
    * **HTTP 400 (Bad Request)**
        * ```badRequest()```
        * ```badRequest(detail)```
    * **HTTP 403 (Forbidden)**
        * ```forbidden()```
        * ```forbidden(detail)```
    * **HTTP 404 (Not Found)**
        * ```notFound()```
        * ```notFound(detail)```
    * **HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error)**
        * ```internalServerError()```
        * ```internalServerError(detail)```
* Call ```JsonApiErrorResponse.status(status, title, detail)``` to build a "simple" custom response
* Manually instantiate a ```JsonApiError``` object and wrap it using ```JsonApiErrorResponse.status(JsonApiError)``` to create a comprehensive response with any field supported by the JSON API error message specification.

### Known Issues
* I18N is not currently supported. All response text is in American English.
* Intrinsic (comment-based) documentation is currently very sparse.
* ```JsonApiHttpErrorHandler``` is not currently covered by unit tests. Dependencies on static classes inside the Play Framework have made this difficult to fix, but test coverage is planned.
